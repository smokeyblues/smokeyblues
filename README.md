## Hi there 👋

My name is Aaron and I build serverless applications on AWS using [SST](https://sst.dev/). 

I am currently working on a storytelling game. Kind of like [Rocksmith](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rocksmith/plus) for Filmmakers and a [first-person shooter](https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_fps/) for visual cinematographers. 

I am also available to help you with your projects. Feel free to reach out.
